# Tello
This project is focused on "Tello – AI-Powered Smart Learning Toy with IoT Connectivity" . Tello is built to engage children in an educational and playful way through audio-visual feedback, object recognition, and interaction. Unlike many existing screen-based systems.
# Problem Description
In today’s fast-paced digital world, children are often exposed to technology at a very early age. However, most learning tools are either too complex or not engaging enough for young minds. Traditional learning methods often fail to keep children interested, especially when it comes to learning about their everyday environment. This motivated us to develop Tello, an AI-powered smart learning toy that combines visual and audio-based learning in an interactive and fun way. The project was inspired by observing how children struggle to associate real-world objects with names, especially when learning new languages or concepts. Tello aims to bridge this gap using object detection, speech synthesis, and an intuitive display interface all within a compact IoT-enabled toy.
